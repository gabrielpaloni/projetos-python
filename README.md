## 📂 Coursework Modules

The content is organized to reflect the learning path of a Computer Science student:

### 1. 🧱 Language Fundamentals
* **Syntax & Semantics:** Understanding variables, data types (int, float, str, bool), and operators.
* **Input/Output:** Basic interaction with the user via console (`print`, `input`) and formatting data.

### 2. 🔀 Control Flow & Logic
* **Conditional Structures:** Decision-making logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to solve problems.
* **Loops & Iteration:** Implementation of `for` and `while` loops to handle repetitive tasks and iterate over sequences.

### 3. 📦 Data Structures & Functions
* **Collections:** Manipulation of Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries to organize data efficiently.
* **Modularization:** Writing clean, reusable code using **Functions**, arguments, and return values to break down complex problems.
