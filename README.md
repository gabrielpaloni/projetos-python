## 📂 Repository Structure

The projects are organized to demonstrate versatility and practical application of Python:

### 1. 🤖 Automation & Scripting
* **Task Automation:** Scripts designed to automate repetitive tasks, file manipulation, and system organization.
* **OS Interaction:** Utilizing libraries like `os` and `sys` to interact with the operating system efficiently.

### 2. 🧠 AI & API Integration
* **Intelligent Agents:** Projects exploring the capabilities of LLMs (Large Language Models), such as integrations with the **Gemini API**.
* **Web Requests:** Handling HTTP requests, consuming RESTful APIs, and processing JSON data structures.
* **Environment Security:** Implementation of `python-dotenv` to manage API keys and sensitive credentials securely.

### 3. 📊 Logic & Data Structures
* **Algorithmic Challenges:** Implementation of logic problems to refine problem-solving skills.
* **Data Manipulation:** Efficient use of Python's core data structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples) to organize and process information.

* **Version Control:** Git

## 🚀 How to Explore
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/gabrielpaloni/projetos-python.git](https://github.com/gabrielpaloni/projetos-python.git)
    ```
2.  **Environment Setup:**
    It is recommended to create a virtual environment for isolated projects:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
    venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
    ```
3.  **Dependencies:**
    Check individual project folders for a `requirements.txt` file and install if necessary:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
